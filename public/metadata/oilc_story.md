# 🛢️ OILCOIN (Oil Coin) — A Vaulted Utility Asset by Project C³

## 🔍 Overview
**OILCOIN ($OILCOIN)** is the first officially Vault-wrapped token under Project C³ — Crystal Clear Commodities™. It represents a fully reclaimed, visually verified, and metadata-authenticated version of a hijacked Solana asset.

Minted with on-chain provenance, governed by a new clean vault wallet, and verified through a 1-of-1 NFT wrapper, $OILCOIN is now the **gold standard for asset integrity in crypto.**

> "Metadata can lie. Vaults don’t."

## 🔧 Why It Matters
Most tokens on Solana are launched anonymously, abandoned quickly, or manipulated visually via old metadata. $OILCOIN was one of them — until Project C³ took over.

This is **Dead Coin Alchemy**: reviving hijacked tokens with:
- Verifiable image + metadata
- Vault NFT minting (Metaplex Master Edition)
- SHA-256 hash-locked assets
- Registry-pinned authority

$OILCOIN now shows the **correct image**, the correct name, and the correct owner — even when traditional wallets (like Phantom or Jupiter) lag behind.

## 🧠 Why a Vault?
Because **metadata is mutable**, but Vaults are:
- On-chain minted
- Immutable in provenance
- Owned by clean wallets
- Linked to burn histories and token narratives

This approach allows any DEX, wallet, or explorer to **visually verify the true state of a token** — without relying on outdated token lists.

## 🔥 The Narrative
OILCOIN is more than a token — it’s a demonstration.

It proves that:
- Projects can restore control after abandonment
- Visual truth can be enforced on-chain
- A meme coin can become an asset-backed commodity token

This is just one Vault. Many more are coming.
