# 🛢️ OILCOIN (Oil Coin) — A Vaulted Utility Asset by Project C³

## 🔍 Overview  
**OILCOIN ($OILCOIN)** is the first officially Vault-wrapped token under **Project C³ — Crystal Clear Commodities™**.  
It represents a fully reclaimed, visually verified, and metadata-authenticated version of a hijacked Solana asset.

Minted with on-chain provenance, governed by a clean Vault wallet, and cryptographically sealed through a 1-of-1 Metaplex Master Edition NFT, $OILCOIN is now the benchmark for token integrity on Solana.

## 🔧 Why It Matters

Most Solana tokens are launched anonymously, abandoned quickly, or visually manipulated through outdated metadata.

$OILCOIN was one of them — until Project C³ took over.

This is **Dead Coin Alchemy**:  
Reviving hijacked tokens with:

- ✅ Verifiable image + metadata  
- ✅ Vault NFT minting (Metaplex Master Edition)  
- ✅ SHA-256 hash-locked image assets  
- ✅ Registry-pinned update authority  

Today, $OILCOIN shows the correct image, correct name, and correct issuer — regardless of what legacy wallets still cache.

## 🧠 Why a Vault?

Because token metadata is mutable. Vaults aren’t.

Vaults are:

- 🔒 Minted on-chain  
- 🔏 Immutable in provenance  
- 🧼 Owned by clean authority wallets  
- 🔥 Linked to supply burns and asset narratives  

This allows any wallet, DEX, or explorer to **independently verify** the truth of a token — even if aggregators lag behind.

## 🔥 The Narrative

OILCOIN isn’t just a token — it’s a **demonstration**.

It proves:

- ✅ Projects can restore control after abandonment  
- ✅ Visual truth can be enforced on-chain  
- ✅ A meme coin can become an asset-backed commodity token  

This is just one Vault.  
**Many more are coming.**
